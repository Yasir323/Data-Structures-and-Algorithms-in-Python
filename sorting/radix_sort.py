"""
Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that
sort in O(n+k) time when elements are in the range
from 1 to k.

What if the elements are in the range from 1 to n2?
We canâ€™t use counting sort because counting sort will
take O(n2) which is worse than comparison-based
sorting algorithms. Can we sort such an array in
linear time?

Radix Sort is the answer. The idea of Radix Sort is
to do digit by digit sort starting from least
significant digit to most significant digit. Radix
sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort.

Let there be d digits in input integers. Radix Sort
takes O(d*(n+b)) time where b is the base for
representing numbers, for example, for the decimal
system, b is 10.
