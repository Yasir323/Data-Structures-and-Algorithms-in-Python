Since same suproblems are called again, this problem
has Overlapping Subprolems property. So the Coin
Change problem has both properties of a dynamic
programming problem. Like other typical Dynamic
Programming(DP) problems, recomputations of same
subproblems can be avoided by constructing a
temporary array table[][] in bottom up manner.
